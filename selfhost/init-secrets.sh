# Runs as the "init" service in compose.yaml before the database and the app start. Each secret is
# a file in $SECRETS_DIR (default /secrets) named after the setting it fills, with "__" standing for
# ":" (so Jwt__Key becomes Jwt:Key). The app reads that folder at startup when
# SelfKept:SecretsDirectory points at it. An environment variable or appsettings value still wins.
#
# These files are the keys to the database and to everything encrypted at rest. Back up the
# "secrets" volume together with the database. Losing it means losing the data it protects.
